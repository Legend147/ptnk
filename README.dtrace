Ptnk includes userspace DTrace probes.

* Supported envs.
Currently only tested on Mac OSX 10.6.7

* Usage
./waf configure build_rel --with-dtrace

sudo dtrace -s ptnk.d -c "build/rel/ptnk_bench --sleep hoge"

* Known bugs
DTrace (at least on osx) can't detect probes immediately after program launch.
Make sure that probes are detected before doing measurement.

The ptnk_bench program has "--sleep" option to ensure this.
