- need refactoring:
  - Page::updateLinks_ depend on mod_info_t, which is deprecated
  - Page::refreshAllLeafPages_ has pgidDep arg, which is not used at all

- workdir may change while run by lib user
  - PartitionedPageIO have to handle that

- documentation: add warnings to TableOffCache
  - can be reused across transactions, but can't be shared by two or more concurrent transactions.

- ptnk_bindump seems to be broken

- remove pgidDep
  -> done partiallly

- Leaf::update may invoke doSplit but may cause no split 
  - update from large val -> small val fragments leaf
  - this fragmentation is invisible from sizeFree
  - doSplit when there is space left
  POSSIBLE FIX: allow doSplit without split

  -> fixed / but no test

- DupKeyLeaf::curUpdate impl.

mysql storage engine known bugs:
- entire db is lost at unknown timing
- TPC-C fails to run

ptnk known issues list:

VERY CRITICAL
- DupKey-tree compaction is not implemented! (may result in record-loss)

CRITICAL
- version number may exceed 64-bit
- pgid may exceed 64-bit
- handle part id > PTNK_MAX_PARTID

FIXLATER
- remove x86_64 dependency
- remove gcc dependency
- make mmap optional

PERFORMANCE ISSUES
- PartitionedPageIO impl. is very inefficient (especially PartitionedPageIO::readPage)

NO TEST
- add test for compaction (check no record loss)
